 Demonstrate buffer overflow attack 
3.	INTRODUCTION
1.	What is buffer 
Buffers are memory storage areas which hold data temporarily while transmitted from one location to another. When the data volume exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer, a buffer overflow or buffer overrun occurs. This overwrites neighboring memory positions by program which attempts to enter data in the buffer. 
Overflows of buffering will impact all software styles. These are usually triggered by malformed inputs or failure to give the buffer adequate time. If the transaction overwrites executable code, the program can be unstable and produce unacceptable results, storage errors or crashes.
2.	What is a Buffer Overflow Attack?
Attackers use buffer overflow issues by overwriting the application's memory. This changes the program's execution path, triggering an answer that damages or discloses private data. An intruder, for example, will enter additional code to send new instructions for accessing IT systems to application.
When attackers are aware of a program's memory layout, they may deliberately feed into an input the buffer can't save and overwrite areas that contain executable code by replacing it with their own code. For example, a pointer (object pointing to another region in memoir) may be overwritten and indicated by an attacker to manipulate the payload, to gain control over the program.
3.	Types of Buffer Overflow Attacks
•	Stack-based buffer overflows are commonly used and the stack memory is used during the execution.
•	Heap based attacks are more difficult to execute and require flooding of the available memory space of a program outside of the memory used for current operations.
4.	What are the more vulnerable programming languages?
C and C++ are two languages that have a high buffer overflow vulnerability, because they have no buffer overflow protections in their memory to overwrite or modify data. All usage of C and C++ code in Mac OSX, Windows and Linux.
Included protection mechanisms for languages like PERL, Java, JavaScript and C # are used which reduce the possibility of buffer overflow.
5.	Vulnserver
Vulnserver is a on port 9999 Windows TCP server. Stephen Bradshaw's blog was posted, whose position is here. The server was written intentionally to be weak in order to learn how an actual target can be fluted.
Spike is a program that sends produced products to an application to crash. The paquets can be set up as models. Spike will send both packets of TCP and UDP. Spike can be used to detect bugs in applications. Spike is in the distribution of Kali
This project demonstrates Spike against Vulnserver in this article. On a Windows 7, Vulnserver runs. As a debugger, I always use OllyDbg.
